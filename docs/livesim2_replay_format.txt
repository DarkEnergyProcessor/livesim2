Live Simulator: 2 binary replay file format. Extension: .lsr
Version 0.4 (subject to change)

Datatypes ("u" suffix means unsigned, except string). All are in little endian:
    qword - 8 bytes
    dword - 4 bytes
    word - 2 bytes
    byte - 1 byte
	Datatype followed by [n] means n-amount of that datatype
	
Header: File header
	dwordu - Header signature (string "ls2r")
	byte[16] - Raw MD5 hash of the beatmap used. If not match, don't load this replay file. Hash data is beatmap format dependent!
	dwordu - Storyboard seed
	dwordu - Score
	dwordu - Max Combo
	dwordu - Total notes
	dwordu - Perfect
	dwordu - Great
	dwordu - Good
	dwordu - Bad
	dwordu - Miss
	dwordu - Token
	dwordu - Max token
	dwordu - Perfect single tap note
	dwordu - Perfect swing note
	dwordu - Perfect simultaneous note (perfect+perfect)
	dwordu - Used Score per Tap
	dwordu[14] - Reserved (encouraged to set to 0)
	dwordu - Timestamp in seconds since January 1st 1970

Accuracy points data:
	dwordu - amount
	for every amount of points data below
		byte - Accuracy. 0 = miss, 1 = bad, 2 = good, 3 = great, 4 = perfect
	end for

Events data: Union type (16 bytes long), so it's easy to be represented as structs (set alignment to 1)
	dword - amount of events
	for every amount of events data below (represented as union)
		byte - type: 0 = keyboard, 1 = touch
		float - time it occured (in note "elapsed time" seconds)
		elseif type == 0 then
			byte - event: 0 = pressed, 1 = released
			byte - lane position
			byte[9] - reserved (padding)
		elseif type == 1 then
			byte - event: 0 = pressed, 1 = moved, 2 = released
			byte[2] - random touch identifier (any char, even unprintable ones). zero byte touch identifier means mouse events.
			float - x position
			float - y position
		end
	end for

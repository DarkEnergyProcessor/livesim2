Live Simulator: 2 binary beatmap file format. Extension: .ls2
Version 2.0

The beatmap format consist of multiple sections, where each
section has FourCC and possibly with size depends on the FourCC itself.
The section can appear in any order. Like, storyboard section can appear
before beatmap section. LS2 parser should expect undefined sections.

Datatypes ("u" suffix means unsigned, except string). All are in little endian:
    qword - 8 bytes
    dword - 4 bytes
    word - 2 bytes
    byte - 1 byte
    string - variable-length string. first dwordu is string length in bytes followed by the data

File information start:

Header: File header
    qword - Header signature. Must be and always be 0x326D69736576696C (string "livesim2")
    wordu - Amount of sections (including unknown sections)
    byteu - * bit 0-3: Used background ID (or 0 to use from BIMG section below or from config)
            * bit 4-6: Force note style (1 = old note style; 2 = v5 note style; 0 = no enforcing)
            * bit 7: Live Simulator: 2 Binary Beatmap v2.0? (introduces backward incompatibility changes to some sections)
    byte  - Stamina display (or -1 to use from config)
    wordu - Score for each note tap (or 0 to use from config)

Sections:
1. MTDT - Live Simulator: 2 metadata. Mandatory in v2.0 or later
    byteu - Metadata information
        * bit 0: Has score information?
        * bit 1: Has combo information?
        * bit 2: Has star information?
        * bit 3: Has random star information? (bit 2 must be 1 too)
    byteu - Star information
        * bit 0-3: Normal star data (or 0 if star information is not available)
        * bit 4-7: Random star data, or 0 if random star information or star information is not available.
                   In that case use previous value from bit 0-3 above.
    string - Song name, or empty string which in that case use from "COVR" data and eventually
             fallback to beatmap filename without extension.
    string - Preferred audio file name. No guarantee that this audio file exists.
    dword - Score needed for C score (or 0 if score info not available)
    dword - Score needed for B score (or 0 if score info not available)
    dword - Score needed for A score (or 0 if score info not available)
    dword - Score needed for S score (or 0 if combo info not available)
    dword - Combo needed for C combo (or 0 if combo info not available)
    dword - Combo needed for B combo (or 0 if combo info not available)
    dword - Combo needed for A combo (or 0 if combo info not available)
    dword - Combo needed for S combo (or 0 if combo info not available)

2. BMPM - Beatmap data with millisecond timing. This section can appear multiple times,
          in which case, the notes data are merged. This section must appear at least once
          if BMPT section doesn't exist.
    dwordu - Amount of notes in this section
    For Every amount of notes above:
        dwordu - Timing milliseconds
        dwordu - Attribute. Some possible values:
                 * bit 0-3: Note images following Sukufesu simulator note colors in order. Ask yuyu for it, lol.
                            * If it's 15 - CBF extension colored note
                                * bit 23-31 - R color (9 bits, unsigned)
                                * bit 14-22 - G color (9 bits, unsigned)
                                * bit 5-13  - B color (9 bits, unsigned)
                 * bit 4: Is swing note?
        dwordu - Note effect
                 * bit 0-3 - Note position. 9 is leftmost, 1 is rightmost
                 * bit 4-5: Note effect.
                            0 = Normal note
                            1 = Token note
                            2 = Long note (bit 6-23 is the length, max 262.143 seconds or 262143 ms length)
                            3 = Star note
                 * bit 24-31: Swing note group (or 0)
                 * Note: There's no way to specify if notes is simultaneous, because it's determined at runtime
    End For

3. BMPT - Beatmap data with tick timing (like MIDI). This section can appear multiple times,
          in which case, the notes data are merged. This section must appear at least once
          if BMPM section doesn't exist.
    word   - PPQN in MIDI. Zero or negative is not allowed
    dwordu - BPM which is premultiplied by 1000 to retain BPM precision. Zero or negative is not a valid value
    dword  - Amount of notes in this section
    For Every amount of notes above:
        * Note: same as BMPM, except timing is in tick, not in milliseconds.
        * If Attribute is 0xFFFFFFFF, then it's tempo change. Note effect is the new BPM premultipled by 1000
    End For

4. SRYL - Lua storyboard. Optional. Only one can be specificed
    string - Lua script data. Optionally zlib compressed
    * Note: Lua script shoudn't be precompiled! This is to ensure compatibility between Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT

5. UIMG - Custom unit image data. Optional. Can appear multiple times
    byte   - Image index
    string - Image data (Only PNG image allowed)

6. UNIT - Custom unit image definition. Optional. Can appear multiple times (max 9)
    byte - Custom unit image definition data amount
    For every data amount
        byte - Unit position. 9 is leftmost
        byte - Image index
    End For

7. BIMG - Custom background image data. Optional. Can appear multiple times
    byteu  - Background index. 0 is center, 1 is left, 2 is right, 3 is top, 4 is bottom

    string - Filename. Path separator must be in forward slash
    string - File data

9. ADIO - Audio/song file. Optional. Only one can be specificed
    byte   - Audio type.
             * bit 0-3: 0 is PCM in WAV, 1 is Vorbis in OGG, 2 is MP3, 3 see below
             * If bit 0-3 is 1, FFmpeg extension audio data.
                * bit 4-7: extension string length, prepended in audio data below
                * Note: If FFmpeg extension not supported, throw error.
    string - Audio data, including the extension prepended if FFmpeg extension audio is used.

10. COVR - Cover data. Optional. Only one can be specificed
    string - Image data (Only PNG image allowed)
